This repo uses openai APIs to filter through social media contents to determine if something matches a users interest or not
The code is written in python
This assumes the existence of a social media data store that provides metadata on social media channels like subreddit, posts and comments
The current functionalities include
* Pulling down items from the content queue and filter them by a given users interests
* Pulling down items from the content queue and determining which ones are of high engagement
